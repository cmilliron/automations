Today’s trending AI news storiesGoogle DeepMind Charts AGI Ambitions While Shifting AIStrategy and InfrastructureGoogle DeepMind predicts that AGI may outthink humans by 2030, detailed in a dense145-page report co-authored by Shane Legg. The report examines risks includingmisuse, misalignment, and structural fragility, and proposes countermeasures such asMONA for interpretable decisions, AI self-assessment tools, and layers of human-ledoversight.This approach sharply contrasts with OpenAI’s automation-heavy strategy, amid criticswho argue that AGI remains an elusive concept with more immediate dangers tied to AI’spropensity to reinforce false outputs.On the infrastructure front, The Information reports that Google is ﬁnalizing a deal withCoreWeave to rent Nvidia Blackwell GPU-powered servers and negotiating to deploy itsown tensor processing units within CoreWeave’s facilities, though neither side hascommented on the report.Meanwhile, DeepMind’s advanced AI agent Dreamer, mastered Minecraft’s diamondcollection challenge without human intervention. Utilizing reinforcement learning and apredictive "world model," Dreamer not only cuts computational costs but alsodemonstrates improved generalization across domains.

The ﬁrm rolled out PaperBench, a rigorous benchmark aimed attesting AI’s mettle in replicating advanced research. Built on 20 ICML 2024 papers with8,316 tasks and graded subtasks, submissions are scored by an AI judge honed onOpenAI’s best models. Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet took the lead by replicating 21%of results—though human PhDs still sit comfortably at 41.4%. The benchmark’s code isout on GitHub.
Image: OpenAIThe company is also in the middle of a bold transformation from nonproﬁt to for-proﬁt,assembling a commission to design the “world’s best-equipped nonproﬁt” with a boardproposal due in 90 days to stave off investor clawbacks.At the same time, OpenAI's o3 model has steeper-than-expected operational costs.Initially projected at $3,000 per ARC-AGI task using its top conﬁguration, o3 high, the ArcPrize Foundation now estimates costs at around $30,000 per task. Although ofﬁcialpricing hasn't been released, o1-pro pricing is expected to be similar. Despite these highcosts, enterprise customers could be charged up to $20,000 monthly for specialized AIagents. Critics note that while these models may be less expensive than humancontractors, their efﬁciency remains in question—o3 high requires 1,024 attempts toachieve optimal performance.

This approach uses component composition to make sureonly context consumers update when the context value changes.I guess some request headers are more trustworthy than others (8minute read)Forbidden request headers are HTTP headers that user agents(browsers) cannot modify. These headers, like fetch metadata requestheaders (sec-fetch-*), can reliably show if a request originates from auser navigating directly in the browser. Forbidden headers like "Host"cannot be overridden.

 Anthropic eyes the college crowd
Northeastern Global NewsOn Wednesday, Anthropic rolled out Claude for Education, a special AI chatbot plantargeting colleges and universities. It’s inspired by OpenAI’s ChatGPT Edu plan but witha key differentiator: Learning Mode—a feature designed to enhance critical thinkingrather than just deliver answers.What makes Learning Mode different? Most AI tools excel at quick Q&A. Claude’sLearning Mode takes a different approach by guiding students through the learningprocess. It asks probing questions, breaks down core principles, and offers templates foressays, research papers, and study guides. The focus? Building critical thinking skillsand encouraging deeper comprehension.Why target colleges?Different use cases: Students are using AI for creative projects, research, andcomplex problem-solving—not just Q&A.Offer AI as a legit learning tool: Colleges increasingly see AI as essential, notoptional. Anthropic wants in.Bigger picture: AI is changing the course of education. And it’s clear thatboth Anthropic and OpenAI want their tools to become synonymous withlearning—and key elements of the workﬂow for a young audience. 
 
 DeepMind’s 145-page AGI manifestoDeepMind dropped a monster 145-page paper on AGI safety this week, and it’s raisingeyebrows. Co-authored by DeepMind co-founder Shane Legg, the report warns that AGIcould emerge by 2030 and lead to “severe harm,” from bad actors to poorly designedsystems spiraling out of control.Key concern: DeepMind’s stance on AGI risk mitigation is way more cautious than thatof OpenAI or Anthropic, both of which it criticizes for lacking robust safeguards.DeepMind emphasized the need for monitoring, security, and hardened AI environments.What’s at stake: While OpenAI and Anthropic are focused on building faster,smarter models, DeepMind is hitting the brakes—at least rhetorically. Butcritics say the report is heavy on doomsday scenarios and light on practicalsolutions. The big question: Can anyone actually control AGI once it’sunleashed? 
 
 Fundraising roundup: AI innovation keeps cashﬂowingTwo major fundraises for startups to watch in AI this week →Actively AI raised $22.5 million to double down on sales “superintelligence,”claiming traditional AI SDRs have ﬂopped. Actively’s approach? Reasoning-driven models designed to mimic top human sales reps’ work.Isomorphic Labs secured a massive $600 million round to power AI-drivendrug discovery. Built on the foundation of DeepMind’s AlphaFold, Isomorphic’sambitious goal is to cure illnesses like cancer and autoimmune diseases with AI.The takeaway? More than 70% of US venture capital went toward AIinvestments during the ﬁrst quarter of this year. The market’s still hot for AIinnovation, especially when it promises to solve big problems—or at leastmake things a little less tedious.

 TODAY IN AI
Runway closed a new funding round as it tries to legitimize AI-powered ﬁlmmaking. Source: Runway1. Hot off the heels of Gen-4, AI video startup Runway is back for more: The Nvidia-backed startup just closed a $308M funding round, more than doubling its valuation to$3B. Due to copyright concerns and doubts about AI’s quality, most big studios haveheld off on using VLMs. Runway plans to prove them wrong by producing its owncontent with a new crew of in-house ﬁlmmakers. Not to be outdone, TikTok ownerByteDance dropped DreamActor-M1, a model that it says turns still images into clipswith unprecedented realism.2. The agents just keep on coming: First up, London’s Convergence AI unveiled anew system called Parallel Agents. As the name suggests, it assigns swarms of agentsto complete different tasks in unison. Along the same lines, Cognition just launchedDevin 2.0, which lets you run your own team of coding agents. They’ll autonomouslytake care of about 80% of your coding needs while you drill down on the 20% that needsyour creative touch.3. Scale AI’s new tool hunts for models’ weaknesses: The SF-based startup, whichsupplies training data to OpenAI, Meta, and even the US Army, says it has come up witha new way to boost the performance of frontier models. Currently, AI companies have tomanually test their LLMs across different benchmarks, one at a time. Scale’s newEvaluation tool can allegedly run thousands of benchmark tests, spot where a model isfalling short, and even suggest which data is needed to ﬁll in the gaps.

 FROM THE FRONTIERLandmark DeepMind study shows AI planning ahead
DeepMind’s model learned how to perform multi-step tasks on its own. Source: DeepMindAn experimental model created by DeepMind learned how to collect diamonds in theopen-world video game Minecraft — a tricky task that involves a lot of trial and error —without being explicitly shown how to do it.Why Minecraft — and why diamonds? The game is procedurally-generated, meaningno two levels are the same. That means DeepMind’s DreamerV3 can’t just memorize thelayout. And before you can ﬁnd a diamond, you ﬁrst need to search for wood, build acrafting table, craft a pickaxe, etc.So, how did Dreamer ﬁgure it out? It used reinforcement learning, the same techniquethat’s used to train reasoning models like OpenAI’s o3 and DeepSeek’s R1. Essentially,it’s rewarded each time it makes progress, helping it gradually self-improve.Why is it a big deal? Researchers say it marks a major milestone as one of the ﬁrsttimes AI has been shown to “imagine future scenarios” and act accordingly. Thetechnique could help us create more generalized LLMs that can learn on the ﬂy withoutspecialized training.Google’s on ﬁre: Gemini 2.5 Pro just turned in the highest score yet on Epoch AI’sscience-based GPQA Diamond test, beating human experts by 14 points. Plus, it lookslike the company might be getting ready to release a new coding-focused model,codenamed “nightwhisper,” which could set a new standard for programming.

Good morning, Cody. AI-generated video has always faced major limitations in lengthand consistency, but new research may have just unlocked a major leap in storytellingcapabilities.With researchers using a new method and a dataset of Tom and Jerry cartoons to createminute-long, coherent generations, the days of short, disconnected AI video clips mayﬁnally be numbered. In today’s AI rundown:NVIDIA and Stanford’s one-minute AI cartoonsAmazon’s new voice model, video upgradeCreate eye-catching thumbnails with GPT-4oMurati’s Thinking Machines adds ex-OpenAI talent4 new AI tools & 4 job opportunitiesLATEST DEVELOPMENTSAI RESEARCH
 NVIDIA and Stanford’s one-minute AI cartoons
Image source: NVIDIA and Stanford UniversityThe Rundown: NVIDIA and Stanford researchers just unveiled "Test-Time Training," anAI technique that enables longer video generation than previously possible—with demosproducing minute-long cartoon clips with improved consistency and storytelling.The details:The system generates full minute-long animations with consistency across scenes,signiﬁcantly outperforming existing methods in human evaluations.TTT layers work by using neural networks as memory, allowing the model toremember and maintain consistency across much longer sequences.The team demoed the tech using Tom and Jerry cartoons, showing multi-scenestories with dynamic motion and character interactions.This approach modiﬁes existing video models, adding TTT layers and enablingthem to handle videos signiﬁcantly longer than their original capability.Why it matters: AI video has seen some mindblowing upgrades over the last year, butone of the biggest constraints is still the length of clips and maintaining consistencyacross shots. This new approach could eventually unlock the ability to tell longer, morecoherent stories—without having to stitch together hundreds of generations.TOGETHER WITH TELY AI

The Rundown: In this tutorial, you will learn how to use ChatGPT's native imagegeneration to create custom YouTube thumbnails instantly — using just simple textprompts, reference images, or even rough sketches.Step-by-step:1. Upload a reference image of yourself or the main subject in ChatGPT, then write adetailed prompt describing exactly what you want in your thumbnail.2. For style consistency, upload both a reference thumbnail you like and your subjectimage, then ask the AI to maintain the style while swapping elements.3. Reﬁne results with follow-up prompts or use the edit feature to highlight areasneeding changes.4. For maximum creative control, upload a rough sketch showing your layout, alongwith any reference images you want to include.Pro tip: You can also use an image expander tool like Canva or Adobe’s Generative Fillto adjust your thumbnail for perfect YouTube dimensions (16:9).PRESENTED BY SANA

Image source: Thinking MachinesThe Rundown: Thinking Machines Lab, the AI startup founded by former OpenAI CTOMira Murati, just added ex-OpenAI CRO Bob McGrew and GPT architect Alec Radford toits list of advisors—bringing the number of OpenAI alumni on its roster to nearly half.The details:19 of 38 listed ‘Founding Team’ members have previously worked at OpenAI,including OpenAI’s co-founder John Schulman, leading as chief scientist.McGrew departed OpenAI in September after eight years, joining Murati justmonths after announcing a break from the industry.Radford was pivotal in creating OpenAI’s GPT technology and left the companylast year to pursue independent research.The startup was recently reportedly seeking to raise as much as $1B at a $9Bvaluation, though little has been revealed on its potential products or roadmaps.Why it matters: Murati continues to gather her former colleagues, with a roster includingmany of the minds behind ChatGPT, DALL-E, and other AI breakthroughs. With all of thecompetition we already have in the AI space, there are still labs from multiple OpenAIleaders in Murati and Ilya Sutskever (SSI) quietly waiting in the wings.QUICK HITS

Read time: under 4 minutesWelcome back, Superhuman. They say what’s old is new again, and Nvidia just provedthe point by using Meta’s Llama 3.1 — Llama 4’s months-old predecessor — to build amodel powerful enough to defeat DeepSeek’s R1. And Amazon shows off two newmodels: One for video and one for audio. Today’s InsightsNvidia’s efﬁcient LLM, Gemini’s real-world uses, and Mira Murati’s startupAmazon unveils cutting-edge video and audio modelsTutorial: How to create UGC style videos with AI5 new AI tools to boost your productivityNews, memes, what’s trending on socials, and more 
  
 TODAY IN AI
Researchers can use Gemini to reason across geospatial data. Source: Google1. Nvidia’s new model beats DeepSeek’s R1 at half the price: The chip giant tweakedMeta’s Llama 3.1 (released months before last week’s Llama 4) to make it morepowerful and energy efﬁcient, even for advanced reasoning tasks. Open models oftenhave a longer shelf life, since anyone can ﬁne-tune them far beyond their original stats.For example, a little-known startup called Deep Cogito just used Llama and Alibaba’sQwen to build a family of open-source LLMs that it claims are now best-in-class for theirsize.2. Gemini helps decode weather, maps, and other real-world trends: Google hasbeen using LLMs to spot patterns in real-world data for years. But until now, you couldn’tsee how data from one model affected the others. Gemini 2.5 is ﬁnally changing that. Itsreasoning capabilities let each model talk to each other, so researchers can work acrossdomains — for example, ﬁguring out how climate change affects public health and thelocal economy in a particular city. Here’s a video with more info.3. Ex-OpenAI CTO’s new startup adds even more top talent: Mira Murati’s secretiveThinking Machines Lab has quietly brought on two OpenAI alums as advisors, includingBob McGrew, the ChatGPT-maker’s former chief research ofﬁcer. All told, Murati’s rosternow includes nearly 20 ex-OpenAI staffers, or about half of the startup’s total lineup. Ithas yet to reveal exactly what it’s working on, although it’s already raised $1B thanks toits star-studded cast.

 FROM THE FRONTIERAmazon closes the distance with new audio, video models
Amazon’s new video model can generate videos up to two minutes in length. Source: AmazonIf you’d already counted Amazon out of the AI race, you might want to think again. Itsnew video model, Nova Reel, just got a major update that lets you generate multi-shotvideos that are up to two minutes long. It also features consistent characters and styles,something that many VLMs still struggle with. Developers can try it out here, but keep inmind, you’ll need a Bedrock account to access it.The e-commerce giant also showed off a new audio model called Nova Sonic that it saysis comparable to OpenAI’s latest voice offerings while being as much as 80% moreaffordable. It has slightly less latency than GPT-4o and is also better at making sense ofmumbles and garbled speech, according to Amazon. Plus, it won’t interrupt you if you’restill in the middle of your sentence.It turns out Alexa+ — the more dynamic, life-like version of Amazon’s chatbot releasedlast month — has already been taking advantage of the new model. But now, developerscan start building with it too. Both models show that after years of lagging behind itsbiggest rivals, Amazon is catching up quickly.

 Google’s protocol for AI agent collaboration
Image source: …The Rundown: Google launched Agent2Agent, a new open protocol that enables AIagents from different developers and frameworks to communicate and collaborate, withbacking from 50+ tech and service giants, including Salesforce, SAP, and PayPal.The details:A2A enables agents to discover capabilities, manage tasks cooperatively, andexchange info across platforms—even without sharing memory or context.The protocol complements Anthropic's popular MCP, focusing on higher-levelagent interactions while MCP handles interactions with external tools.Launch partners include enterprise players like Atlassian, ServiceNow, andWorkday, along with consulting ﬁrms like Accenture, Deloitte, and McKinsey.The system also supports complex workﬂows like hiring, where multiple agentscan do candidate sourcing and background checks without humans in the loop.Why it matters: AI agents are rapidly growing in capabilities, but unlocking their truecapabilities will require a standard, streamlined way to interact with each other acrossplatforms and frameworks. A2A could build on the success of MCP, helping build aninterconnected system that allows multi-agent collaboration to tackle complex tasks.AI TRAINING

 TODAY IN AI
Google can now interpret images, photos, and audio. Source: Alphabet1. OpenAI could buy Jony Ive’s AI gadget startup: The mysterious AI device SamAltman is cooking up with legendary ex-Apple designer Jony Ive could soon become anofﬁcial product of OpenAI. The ChatGPT-maker has reportedly ﬂoated acquiring Altmanand Ive’s startup, io Products, for over $500M. Inspired by the 2013 sci-ﬁ movie “Her,”the assistant will supposedly be controlled entirely with the user’s voice, removing theneed for a screen.2. Google is giving your phone eyes and ears: The search giant is rolling out ProjectAstra capabilities in Gemini Live, which will let users share anything with the Gemini appusing their camera or sharing their screens. The feature essentially lets the appunderstand your questions or tasks more deeply, and provide richer responses.

 FROM THE FRONTIERNew Stanford report shows China’s frontier AI is catchingup fast
China is quickly closing the distance when it comes to frontier LLMs.The US released 40 top-tier AI models last year, compared to just 15 from China. But interms of model quality, China has almost completely closed the distance, according toStanford’s latest AI Index.How so? Chinese models now score about the same as their US counterparts on twomajor performance benchmarks. That’s a stark difference from 2023, when there wasstill a double-digit separation between the nations’ top LLMs. That’s all the moreimpressive once you consider American startups got nearly 12x more investments thantheir Chinese counterparts.But the divide between open and closed-source models might be just asimportant: Last year, about 61% of the most advanced models were closed. But therewas only a 1.7% gap between the best open and closed-source models, down from 8%the year before.Meta’s new open-source Llama 4 could make those margins even narrower: Andwith DeepSeek’s R2 coming any week now, the tables could turn completely, putting anopen-source model on top for a change. The relatively small Chinese startup hasalready unveiled a new training technique that boosts models’ reasoning capabilities,and could make its way to future releases.

Good morning, Cody. Apple's legendary design wizard and OpenAI's visionary CEOhave been quietly building the next generation of AI devices — and now, their creationsmight become an ofﬁcial part of the OpenAI family.With concepts like "phones without screens" in development and former Apple execs onthe design front, could an OpenAI device be the 'iPhone moment' that AI hardwaredesperately needs? In today’s AI rundown:OpenAI eyes Jony Ive's AI device startupGoogle expands Gemini Live video featuresBuild an AI sales rep that qualiﬁes leads with ZapierShopify mandates company-wide AI usage4 new AI tools & 4 job opportunitiesLATEST DEVELOPMENTSOPENAI
 OpenAI eyes Jony Ive's AI device startup
Image source: GPT-4o / The RundownThe Rundown: OpenAI is reportedly in talks to acquire io Products, a secretive AIhardware startup led by former Apple design chief Jony Ive and backed by OpenAI CEOSam Altman, potentially valuing the company at over $500M.The details:io Products is reportedly developing AI-powered personal devices and householdproducts, including a "phone without a screen" concept.Ive and Altman began collaborating over a year ago, with Altman closely involvedin the product development and the duo seeking to raise $1B.Several prominent former Apple executives, including Tang Tan (who previouslyled iPhone hardware design) and Evans Hankey, have also joined the project.The device in question is reportedly built by io Products, designed by Ive’s studioLoveFrom, and powered by OpenAI’s AI models.Why it matters: While OpenAI's acquisition of an Altman-associated startup would comewith its drama, the AI leader has repeatedly expressed interest in hardware. A unique,powerful OpenAI wearable or device would potentially be an ‘iPhone’ moment for AIhardware, especially as attempts from others have left plenty to be desired.TOGETHER WITH VANTA

 Google expands Gemini Live video features
Image source: GoogleThe Rundown: Google just announced an expanded rollout of Gemini Live's “ProjectAstra” capabilities, bringing real-time visual AI features to more Android devices andintroducing new ways to interact with the AI through video and screen sharing.The details:The feature allows users to have multilingual conversations with Gemini aboutanything they see and hear through their phone's camera or via screen sharing.The feature is rolling out today to all Pixel 9 and Samsung Galaxy S25 devices,with Samsung offering it at no additional cost to their ﬂagship users.Initial testing revealed the current "live" feature works more like enhanced GoogleLens snapshots rather than continuous video analysis shown in demos.Project Astra was initially revealed at Google I/O last May, with the feature rollingout for the ﬁrst time last month to Advanced subscribers.Why it matters: AI continues to gain more capabilities to see and understand the worldaround us — and while this implementation may not be the full Astra we initially saw,real-time visual analysis is coming quickly. Imagining this tech tied into smartglasses orwearables might be the ultimate ﬁnal form that unlocks fully context-aware assistants.AI TRAINING

 Shopify mandates company-wide AI usage
Image source: Getty ImagesThe Rundown: Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke released an internal memo mandating AIproﬁciency across the commerce giant, declaring that teams must prove AI can’t do thejob before seeking additional resources and making AI a “baseline expectation.”The details:The memo establishes "reﬂexive AI usage" as a baseline expectation for allemployees, with AI competency now included in performance evaluations.Shopify is providing access to AI tools like Copilot, Cursor, and Claude for codedevelopment, along with dedicated channels for sharing AI best practices.Lütke said that teams must now demonstrate why AI solutions can't handle workbefore being approved for new hires or resources.He also described AI as a multiplier that has enabled top performers to accomplish"implausible tasks" and achieve "100X the work”.Why it matters: The memo highlights a growing divide in corporate AI strategies —while some are banning AI entirely or moving slowly, forward-thinking ﬁrms like Shopifyare treating AI adoption as non-negotiable. Its use is also clearly becoming a directalternative to hiring, with Lutke asking what AI can handle before adding more humans.QUICK HITS

Welcome back, Superhuman. Have you herd the news? Okay, terrible pun — butworth it, because a powerful new family of Llama 4 models just dropped over theweekend. And: I have good news and bad news about GPT-5. To pull the band-aid offquick, it’s taking longer than expected, but there’s a surprising upside. Today’s InsightsLlama 4, Copilot reimagined, Midjourney’s V7, and GPT-5’s roadmapEverything you need to know about Llama 4Tutorial: How to use agents for competitive analysis5 new AI tools to boost your productivityNews, memes, what’s trending on socials, and more 
  
 TODAY IN AI
Midjourney’s V7 is built on a completely new architecture. Source: Midjourney1. Meta just dropped Llama 4: The social media giant showed off three versions of itslong-awaited Llama 4 model, which each offer “unrivaled speed and efﬁciency” whilebeing open to researchers. More details below.2. Microsoft celebrates 50 years with revamped Copilot: The company just jolted itsCopilot chatbot back into relevancy with some major updates. It can now rememberdetails about your life, including food preferences, hobbies, and friends’ birthdays. Andan “actions” tool can complete tasks for you, like buying tickets or ﬁlling out forms.Here’s a video with even more features, including AI-generated podcasts, visioncapabilities, deep research, and customization.3. Midjourney heats up image-gen race with V7: Almost a year since its last majorupgrade, Midjourney is back with V7 Alpha, which was built on an entirely newarchitecture and, for the ﬁrst time, lets you generate images just by talking to it. Plus, anew Draft Mode generates images at 10x the speed so you can brainstorm beforelanding on a ﬁnal design. To try it out, you’ll ﬁrst need to create a personalization proﬁlehere.4. OpenAI is scrapping its original GPT-5 roadmap: CEO Sam Altman revealed thatGPT-5 is still months away because it was harder than anticipated to integrate all of thecompany’s models into a single product. On the plus side, GPT-5 will be “much better”than even OpenAI was expecting. And the cherry on top: The full version of o3 as wellas o4-mini are going to launch as separate models after all, and they’re only a couple ofweeks away.

 FROM THE FRONTIERLlama 4 stampedes onto the scene
Meta dropped a new collection of LLMs. Source: MetaMeta didn’t even bother waiting until Monday. Over the weekend, it unveiled a newfamily of models, which you can try out in your browser — or on WhatsApp, Messenger,and Instagram. And if you’re developer, you can start building with it here.Here’s a rundown of each one:Scout: Built for efﬁciency, this one’s capable of running on a single Nvidia chip. Itbeats open-source rivals like Google’s Gemma 3, making it “the best multimodalmodel in its class.” And it has an industry-leading 10M-token context window,meaning it can theoretically handle longer documents and conversations.Maverick: This one’s ideal for apps that involve both text and images, like acustomer support bot that can analyze photo uploads. Plus, it works across 12languages.Behemoth: The most powerful of the bunch, this is the model the others weredistilled from. Considered “among the world’s smartest LLMs,” it outperforms GPT-4.5 and Claude 3.7 across STEM-focused benchmarks. But it’s the only one thathasn’t been released to the public yet.The backstory: The Information reported last week that the new collection wassupposed to come out sooner but failed to meet internal benchmarks — a story we’veheard repeatedly across the industry. To keep up with the competition, Meta allegedlytook cues from China’s DeepSeek, which boosted R1’s efﬁciency by training differentparts of its model to be good at speciﬁc tasks.

The robots aren’t coming — they’re already here and are clocking in for the morning shift.From factory ﬂoors to ﬁlm sets, humanoid robots are leading the charge in industrialautomation. Meanwhile, autonomous ﬂying taxis are taking to the sky in China aftergetting the green light from state authorities.P.S. The Robotics Special is designed to help you stay on the cutting edge of the latestbreakthroughs and products in the industry. Our regular AI and Tech updates will resumeas usual on Monday. WHAT’S NEXTThe most important news and breakthroughs in robotics thisweek
China’s low-altitude economy is projected to hit $207B in 2025. Source: News BytesSky Cab: Two Chinese companies have ofﬁcially received regulatory approval to launchautonomous passenger drones into the sky, starting with short-distance tourism routesbefore expanding into broader urban networks. Clocking in at speeds up to 81 mph, theseﬂying taxis are part of China’s growing low-altitude economy, projected to be worth $207Bby the end of this year. Watch them soar the skies here.Work Warrior: Agility Robotics has made major upgrades to its Digit humanoid robot,including longer battery life, autonomous docking, and integration with autonomousmobile robots (AMRs) to boost efﬁciency at work. The humanoid's improved safetyfeatures show signiﬁcant progress toward meeting industry standards for workingalongside humans, positioning Digit as a key player in next-gen industrial automation.Circuit Server: Shanghai-based robotics ﬁrm Keenon Robotics has unveiled the XMAN-R1, a humanoid robot designed to fast-track automation in the hospitality space. Capableof taking orders, preparing food, and interacting with customers, XMAN-R1 worksseamlessly within the company's wider ecosystem of service robots, making it a good ﬁtfor the industry’s more personal, customer-facing roles. Watch it in action here.Virtual Vanguard: Accenture and Schaefﬂer are teaming up to overhaul industrialautomation. The collaboration uses NVIDIA Omniverse to simulate factory layouts androbot operations. Advanced humanoid robots learn tasks by observing humans, withmovements captured and translated back into simulations. As nearly half of factorymanagers expect AMRs and humanoid robots to become standard in factories, this couldmake factory operations smarter, faster, and more adaptable. SPONSORED BY MODE MOBILEThis tech company grew 32,481%...
No, it's not Nvidia… It's Mode Mobile, 2023’s fastest-growing software companyaccording to Deloitte.Their disruptive EarnPhone has helped users earn an eye-popping $325M+, driving$60M+ in revenue and a massive 45M+ consumer base. Like Uber turned vehicles intoincome-generating assets, Mode is turning smartphones into an easy passive incomesource.They’ve just secured the Nasdaq ticker $MODE, but you can still invest at $0.26/share.Their share price is changing soon - invest now and earn up to 2X bonus shares. ROBOTS IN ACTIONHow robots are transforming the world around us
MIT researchers test the vine robot in a laboratory setting. Image Source: Glen Cooper / MITLights, Camera, Action: In a partnership with NVIDIA and Canon, Boston Dynamics’Atlas humanoid is making its debut as a camera operator on a ﬁlm set. Its ability to handleheavy equipment and repeat complex shots could have huge implications for virtualproduction, especially when it comes to shooting in tough locations.007 of the Seas: Defense company Anduril has unveiled the Seabed Sentry, an AI-powered spy robot capable of operating in oceanic depths greater than 500 meters formonths or even years. It improves real-time maritime awareness for both commercial andmilitary applications.Quality Check: Auto manufacturer Audi has introduced UBTech’s Walker S1 humanoidrobot at its Changchun, China plant to handle essential quality inspections like detectingrefrigerant leaks in air-conditioning systems. The Walker S1's precision and stability makeit a key asset in hazardous environments.Debris Detective: MIT engineers have developed SPROUT, a low-cost, ﬂexible "vinerobot" that can navigate through rubble to help rescue teams locate survivors after majorcollapse events. The robot's soft, inﬂatable body allows it to squeeze through tight spacesand map the best ingress routes into the debris. You can watch it in action here. FROM THE FRONTIERUC Berkeley researchers use magnets to power the world’stiniest ﬂying robot
The robot is 21 mg in weight and 9.4 mm in wingspan, making it the lightest and smallest ﬂying robot in the world.Source: Adam Lau/Berkeley EngineeringBuilding a tiny ﬂying robot has presented scientists with a paradox. As devices getsmaller, batteries tend to become disproportionately heavy and bulky. Traditional solutionslike tethering miniature robots to power sources cramped their movement and held themback in real-world applications. Engineers needed to ﬁnd a way to power small ﬂyingrobots without the weight penalty of onboard power systems.Scientists at UC Berkeley decided to ﬂip the script. The goal was to build a prototypethat could ﬂy anywhere without being tethered to a constant power source. To circlearound the miniaturization challenge, the team used an external magnetic ﬁeld to powerthe mini-drone and control its ﬂight. The robot’s body is 3D printed and packs a pair ofpermanent magnets, which respond to the magnetic ﬁeld to generate lift.The design is surprisingly robust — it can right itself after collisions, and the lift forcegenerated by the robot exceeded its own weight by approximately 14%. It’s also energy-efﬁcient, converting power to lift more effectively than nearly all other ﬂying robots andeven outperforming natural ﬂyers like fruit ﬂies and hummingbirds.But there’s still some ground to cover. The current range of these robots is limited toabout 10 centimeters away from the magnetic ﬁeld. However, future improvements couldextend the robots’ operational range, potentially revolutionizing search and rescueoperations, industrial machinery, and plant pollination. PRESENTED BY NEBIUSLooking for the cutting-edge GPUs for your next AI project?

Digest #548 | Building with AI? Get Pro and join the communityHey folks,we are creating a series of short FAQ like explainers on topics that seem tootechnical but keep popping up everywhere. We’re starting with MCP (read thepost here). What other topics would you like me to explain?Let’s get into it  
 What’s TrendingIn just the Wrst day of Cloud Next, Google has bamboozled my mind with thenumber of features launched. Haven’t got access or the time to try them all,but here’s the dispatch:First up, Google Workspace - Docs got audio overviews, Sheets got AIanalysis, and there’s a new automation creator—Workspace Flows. Flowsconnect different Google apps like Forms, Sheets, Chat, along with Gemini& Gems. Yep, you can add an AI step between your `ows. (moreworkspace launches)Gemini API has two new entries: 1. Live API for real-time talkingapplications—audio in, audio out. 2. Veo 2 for video generation is nowavailable to all paying developers. Also, Google AI Studio has a new look.Gemini 2.5 Flash was teased but we have zero info about it.Let’s talk Agents now. Agentspace, the enterprise platform for buildingagents, now has integrations like search, external data and more. It alsohas pre-built agents like Deep Research and Idea Generation agents.Looks like after some initial setup, you can conWgure these agents withsimple prompts.There’s new developer tooling too: Agent Development Kit (ADK), anotheragent framework, and A2A, a new protocol for Agent-to-Agentcommunication. You can also deploy/run your agents built with anyframework or tooling on Agent Engine without hunting for other tools.But here’s the most important news for us: Google now has its own text-to-app tool. Firebase Studio helps you make an app like Bolt or Lovable can, butit feels richer in features. It gives you a preview of what it’ll build, allows youto easily edit code manually, select elements on screen and easy deployment.I need to play more with it, but it looks really insane (and fast).Claude’s got the OpenAI bug. You can now get Claude MAX by paying $100(5x higher limits) or $200 (20x higher limits) to Anthropic for letting you useClaude more. No extra features for now, that’s it.Midjourney is not dead yet—after a year, they have released Midjourney V7.It’s a smarter model and creates beautiful images (that 4o fails at). Thislaunch also comes with a new draft mode for lower cost and fastergenerations.Building AI apps but stuck tweaking prompts?

 Dear Ben… what is MCP?LLMs are getting more capable, but are still siloed by default. Each integration isbespoke, every model has its own quirks, and context still resets between apps.Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has been a popular attempt to solve thisproblem. While RAG works, there’s a new term creating buzz – MCP .Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a proposed standard that aims to makeconnecting AI applications to external data sources easier.I have been struggling to understand how MCP stands out amongst dozens ofexisting solutions and the reason why we need a common standard. Every postonline is about “how MCP works”, but I want to understand why we should careabout it.So we did some research and spoke to our community to identify some keyquestions that we answer.Q1: What is MCP?Q2: How is it different from “tool calling”?Q3: Does a normal user need to learn MCP?Q4: Is it like HTTPS? Why not?Q5: How will companies adopt MCP?Q6: What’s the best way to look at MCP—now and in future.The questions in the post are more nuanced and answer my doubts around MCP .Hopefully, it helps you get a better look at MCP , keeping all the hype aside.Read the full post for free →

Welcome back, Superhuman. There’s nothing more dangerous than a trillion dollarcompany that operates like a startup. After being relatively slow to the gen AI party,Google now has a clear lead with the chart-topping Gemini 2.5 Pro. Their CEO isrunning polls on X and responding directly to user feedback. And yesterday the companyannounced more AI features in a day than most startups announce in a year. It’s timeeveryone started fearing Google again. Today’s InsightsNew releases, Claude’s new tier, and Grok 3 has an APIEverything you need to know about the new Google releasesTutorial: How to instantly research arXiv papers with AI5 new AI tools to boost your productivityNews, memes, what’s trending on socials, and more 
  
 TODAY IN AI
Source: DeepMind1. Google wows with major new releases: The Gemini maker came to a knife ﬁghtpacking a bazooka. Gemini 2.5 Flash was announced. The video model Veo 2 is nowavailable to developers via the Gemini API. Live API is ready for production as well.Firebase Studio will now let anyone build an app with just a few prompts. There’s a newTPU chip that specializes in inference. There’s also a new open protocol that lets AIagents securely collaborate across ecosystems. More details on everything below.2. Grok 3 is now available in API: Developers will get access to 2 models: Grok 3 andGrok 3 Mini. Grok 3 is priced at $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million outputtokens. Meanwhile, Grok 3 Mini will cost $0.30 per million input tokens and $0.50 permillion output tokens. Pricing seems to be on par with Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet butmore expensive compared to Gemini 2.5 Pro.3. Anthropic launches new Claude plans with higher usage limits: Power usershave been complaining about getting rate limited on Claude for some time now (thisincludes me). So it’s welcome news that Claude now has new pricing tiers that comewith 5x more usage for $100/month and 20x more usage for $200/month. Users whoupgrade to the new Max plan will also get priority access to the latest features andmodels.

The universe was supposed to self-destruct 13.8 billion years ago, but a new study shedslight on how we may have dodged that bullet. Meanwhile, scientists seem to have ﬁnallyﬁgured out why your Spotify Wrapped looks the way it does.P.S. The Sunday Special is designed to help you discover the most important scientiﬁcand technological breakthroughs outside of AI. Our regular AI and Tech updates willresume as usual on Monday. SCIENCE SUNDAYThe most interesting scientiﬁc discoveries andbreakthroughs this week
A mismatch in matter and antimatter decay could potentially explain why the universe didn’t annihilate after the BigBang. Image Source: zombiu26 / Adobe StockCosmic Chaos: The fact that we exist at all has had physicists stumped for decades. TheBig Bang should have created equal amounts of matter and antimatter, which would haveannihilated each other, leaving the universe empty. Now, physicists are cluing in on whythis didn’t happen, hinting at a mysterious imbalance in the rate at which matter andantimatter decay. This small mismatch might explain why a little more matter prevailedafter the Big Bang, allowing stars, planets, and life to form.Quantum Quake: Scientists claim to have demonstrated what could be the ﬁrst-everpractical application of quantum computing. Using a 56-qubit quantum computer, theyused a "certiﬁed randomness protocol" to generate truly random numbers — somethingclassical computers can’t quite replicate. This has potential implications for cryptographyand data security. While full-scale quantum computing remains distant, it’s a majormilestone toward practical quantum applications.Cells in Sync: Scientists have long wondered how complex life forms like humansevolved from single-celled organisms. Now, a new study has revealed that large single-cell organisms called stentors were able to vacuum up more food when they bandedtogether, ramping up their feeding efﬁciency. This cooperative behavior of unicellularorganisms could have been a crucial step in the eventual evolution of multicellular life onEarth.Musical Mystery: A twin study of over 9,000 participants revealed that more than half ofthe differences in how people enjoy music are wired deep within our DNA. Researchersfound that different genetic pathways were also found to inﬂuence speciﬁc aspects ofmusic enjoyment, such as emotional response or dancing to rhythm. The ﬁndings couldhelp explain why people experience music differently.Decoding Death: Scientists have developed a neuroscientiﬁc model that explains near-death experiences (NDEs) as a physiological phenomenon. When oxygen drops andcarbon dioxide rises during critical events like cardiac arrest, the brain releases a surge ofneurotransmitters that can trigger vivid perceptions, like out-of-body sensations, adistorted awareness of time, or a sense of calm. The model is still purely theoretical andrequires further empirical testing. PRESENTED BY EIGHT SLEEPHow I get an extra 400 hours of sleep per year

Good morning, Cody. Meta’s hotly-anticipated Llama 4 family is here — with a surpriseweekend release debuting new open-weights models with massive context windows andbenchmark-beating performances.With a 2T “Behemoth” still in training and claims of outperforming GPT-4.5, is this releasea true next-gen step forward? Or will user experience tell a different story? In today’s AI rundown:Meta launches Llama 4 model familyCopilot’s new personalization upgradesUnlock the power of AI across your apps‘AI 2027’ forecasts existential risks of ASI4 new AI tools & 4 job opportunitiesLATEST DEVELOPMENTSMETA
 Meta launches Llama 4 model family
Image source: MetaThe Rundown: Meta just announced its Llama 4 family with multimodal capabilities andindustry-leading context length—introducing new open-weights Scout and Maverickmodels and previewing a 2T parameter Behemoth model still in training.The details:The 109B parameter Scout features a 10M token context window and can run on asingle H100 GPU, surpassing Gemma 3 and Mistral 3 on benchmarks.The 400B Maverick brings a 1M token context window and beats both GPT-4o andGemini 2.0 Flash on key benchmarks while being more cost-efﬁcient.Meta also previewed Llama 4 Behemoth, a 2T-parameter teacher model still intraining that reportedly outperforms GPT-4.5, Claude 3.7, and Gemini 2.0 Pro.All models use a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, where speciﬁc expertsactivate for each token, reducing computation needs and inference costs.Scout and Maverick are available for immediate download and can also beaccessed via Meta AI in WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram.Why it matters: After DeepSeek R1 disrupted the open-source market earlier this year,Meta needed a strong response. Llama 4 represents a step up in efﬁciency, massivecontext handling, and multimodal capabilities — but questions remain on whether themodels truly feel next-level despite the strong benchmarks.TOGETHER WITH CONCIERGE

 ‘AI 2027’ forecasts existential risks of ASI
Image source: AI Futures ProjectThe Rundown: Former OpenAI researcher Daniel Kokotajlo and the AI Futures Projectpublished “AI 2027,” predicting advancement to superhuman AI within two years,potentially triggering an intelligence explosion with consequences for humanity.The details:The report outlines a timeline starting with increasingly capable AI agents in 2025,evolving into superhuman coding systems and then full AGI by 2027.The paper details two scenarios: one where nations push ahead despite safetyconcerns, and another where a slowdown enables better safety measures.The authors project that superintelligence will achieve years of technologicalprogress each week, leading to domination of the global economy by 2029.The scenarios highlight issues like geopolitical risks, AI’s deployment into militarysystems, and the need for understanding internal reasoning.Kokotajlo left OpenAI in 2024 and led the ‘Right to Warn’ open letter, speaking outagainst the AI labs’ lack of safety concerns and whistleblower protections.Why it matters: While many dismiss AGI and ASI predictions, this forecast comes fromresearchers with direct, insider experience at leading AI labs. These scenarios suggestwe may have only a brief window to ensure AI remains controllable before it surpassesour abilities — making current safety and policy decisions critically important.QUICK HITS

Today’s trending AI news storiesOpenAI Forced to Delay GPT-5 Launch: 'It’s Harder ThanWe Thought'OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has delayed the launch of GPT-5 by several months, citingintegration challenges and unexpectedly high performance gains uncovered duringdevelopment. Instead, OpenAI will release the o3 and o4-mini models in the comingweeks—previously planned as internal components of GPT-5. The o3 model, inparticular, has been internally benchmarked at the level of a top-tier coder.Altman pointed to three key reasons for the shift: the complexity of merging features intoa single system, the need to scale infrastructure for unprecedented demand, and theopportunity to push GPT-5 far beyond initial expectations. The o-series will serve asinterim steps, offering scalable architecture, multimodal capabilities, and cost-effectiveinference.
Sam Altman@sama
change of plans: we are going to release o3 and o4-mini after all,probably in a couple of weeks, and then do GPT-5 in a few months.there are a bunch of reasons for this, but the most exciting one isthat we are going to be able to make GPT-5 much better than weoriginally

Image: MetaMeta has launched two models from its Llama 4 family: Scout and Maverick, both nowintegrated into Meta AI across WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram.Maverick, designed for general assistant tasks, contains 400 billion total parameters butactivates only 17 billion across 128 experts. Scout, optimized for summarization andcode reasoning, supports a 10 million token context window and can run on a singleNvidia H100 GPU.Meta also previewed Llama 4 Behemoth, still in training, with 288 billion activeparameters, positioning it as a future top-tier base model and reportedly outperformsmodels like GPT-4.5 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on STEM benchmarks. However, none ofthese models qualify as “reasoning” models that fact-check answers.CEO Mark Zuckerberg added that a fourth model, Llama 4 Reasoning, will be introducedwithin weeks. All models employ a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to boostefﬁciency and multimodal performance. Despite their open-weight release, Meta hasbarred EU-based developers from using the models, citing regulatory uncertainty underthe EU AI Act.The Maverick model, ranked second on LM Arena, has raised concerns due todiscrepancies between its benchmarked and public versions. Researchers noted that theLM Arena version is an experimental, "chat-optimized" model, ﬁne-tuned forconversation, while the publicly available model differs, using excessive emojis and long-winded answers. This raises serious questions about the integrity of benchmarks,suggesting some models are engineered to perform well in tests while leavingdevelopers in the dark about their true real-world capabilities.
